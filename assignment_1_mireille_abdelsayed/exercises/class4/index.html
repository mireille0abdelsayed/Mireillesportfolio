    <h2>The Beginning</h2>

    <p>He was walking to work in his hometown of Daraa, the southern Syrian city where the protests against President Bashar al-Assad first erupted. For young civilians like Faez, now 28, leaving the house in the spring of 2013 had become a game of
      Russian roulette. Dozens were dying each day in the civil war between Assadâ€™s forces and antigovernment insurgents. The ancient farming town of Daraa had become a grisly battlefield. Dissidents had disappeared. Children had been plucked off the
      streets for suspected anti-government activities, only to be tortured by authorities</p>

    <p>On that Tuesday morning in late March, Faez was confronted by a group of Syrian army soldiers. They were looking for a man who had been spotted with a handgun. Faez and three others were detained and accused of being terrorists. Standing at
      gunpoint, his hands in the air, he recalls feeling furious with himself for risking the solo walk to work.</p>

    <p id="ruins" class="pull_quote">We felt death upon us, and we accepted it</p>

    <p>He got lucky. At that moment, an old woman barreled into the street, begging the gun-toting soldiers to spare these men. They were her son, her nephew, her neighbors, the old lady pleaded. Faez had never seen the woman before. But the soldiers
      relented. The stranger saved his life.</p>

    <p>By the time Faez returned home that night from his job at a healthcare company, he had resolved to flee Syria. He talked it over with his wife, informed his mother, and then reached out online to an underground group known for smuggling
      Syrians into Jordan. Again Faez was fortunate: the smugglers had space in a private car to carry him and his wife to the border the next day.</p>

    <p>The couple packed their bags with clothing, photos from their wedding and a few keepsakes: a set of colored bowls they had received as a gift, a glimmering golden plate inscribed with the Shahada, the Muslim profession of faith. The following
      morning, they walked out the door and left their life behind.

<p>"Rescued by Dorothy from his dull life in a farmer's field, the Scarecrow's greatest wish is to procure brains for himself from the Wizard of Oz. Despite his perceived lack of brains, however, the Scarecrow is exceedingly intelligent and resourceful. At the end of the novel he becomes the ruler of Emerald City in the Wizard's absence."</p>

<h2>MAC burgers</h2>

    <p>Design: The design looks fun and inviting, you clearly get what the site is about, burgers.</p>

    <p>Usability: The site had a very nice user experience. Everything was well indicated on the site. When you clicked on the Uber, it would direct you directly to the UberEATS site.  </p>

    <p>Content: The content was all present, from the address to the phone number, email, prices of each article, and even the story on how the store started. </p>

    <p>Creativity: For a restaurant, I feel like this is an innovative way to introduce yourself and display your menu. </p>

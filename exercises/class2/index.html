<h2>Coastal World</h2>

    <p>Design: The design is very nice and cute, it had me smiling the whole time. However, I felt like it was more of an actual game then a banking website.</p>

    <p>Usability: If you are a teen or young adult using this site, I would say that it is very user friendly because it is exactly like any game that you could’ve played when you were younger, such as Club Penguin. However, I don’t see my grandparents or even parents using this site or understanding how it works. </p>

    <p>Content: During the 30 mins that I spent on this website, I realized that even though it was a community banking site, not much information was being communicated.</p>

    <p>Creativity: This website was super creative, it felt like I was playing a game.</p>

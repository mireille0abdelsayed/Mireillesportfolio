    <p>Design: This website looks amazing! It looks like an actual house/museum for the NBA X Hennessy collaboration. Things are presented clearly and makes you appreciate everything.</p>

    <p>Usability: This site was very user friendly. Before beginning, little pop-ups would appear and would explain how you could navigate through the site </p>

    <p>Content: The content was all very interesting, from little recipes for NBA x Hennessy inspired drinks, to a museum of some jerseys and even a performance. </p>

    <p>Creativity: The aspect of navigating through a space might not be very innovative, however, it was very well executed and had a very clean design.</p>
